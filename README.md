# Overview of the workshop

In this 4-hour workshop, participants will learn the basics of data modelling for relational databases, the relational database development process, and querying relational databases using SQL (Structured Query Language). The workshop will also present an overview of how relational databases are integrated into websites and other types of applications. The workshop will include a number of hands-on exercises and the chance to create, populate, and query a simple database.

# Integrating Relational Databases into Applications

Examples: Wordpress database model (https://codex.wordpress.org/images/9/97/WP3.8-ERD.png); Firefox's history feature (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places)

# Relational Databases Compared to Other Types of Databases

NoSQL databases: Store non-tabular data. Examples include CouchDB, MongoDB. Typical applications serve large-scale structured data or as complements to relational database applications. No standardized query language.

XML databases: Stores and queries XML documents, not tables. Typical application is for advanced queries against a set of XML documents using teh XPath or XQuery languages. Examples include eXist, BaseX.

Triplestores: Store statements comprised of subject, predicate, object as defined by RDF (Resource Description Framework). Typical application is in providing a search endpoint for Linked Data via the SPARQL query language. Examples include Fuseki, JENA, Virtuoso.
